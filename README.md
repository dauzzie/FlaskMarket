# FlaskMarket


## Description
---
A Flask web application used to make markets with users and items sellable and buyable.

## Tech Stack Used
---
Flask, Jinja, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, Python

## Things Learned
---
1. Flask is pretty neat and lightweight! A lot of built-in libraries to help build a simple web app
2. Flask has integrated routing => `@app.route(<path>)`
3. Refreshed knowledge on Bootstrap templates
4. Jinja can be used outside of Python with `{{}}` for data and `{%%}` for operations
5. Backend-wise, Python feels more solid
6. Prevent circular imports by introducing `__init__.py` files on packages

## Questions
---
- Are there any validations for Mongo? Security?
- React security practices against e.g. CSRF?
- Are there `flash()` in React?
- What does `aria-label` and `data-dismiss` do?

## Suggestions for Improvement
